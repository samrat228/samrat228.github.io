<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue; text-align: center"> Almaty - city of 1000 colors </h1>
<p><b>Almaty</b> is the largest city in Kazakhstan, with a population of about 2 million. 
    <br>
    It was the capital of Kazakhstan from 1929 to 1936 as a autonomous republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic 
    <br>
    as part of the Soviet Union, then from 1936 to 1991 as a union republic and finally from 1991 as an independent state to 1997, 
    <br>
    when the government relocated the capital to Akmola (renamed Astana in 1998, and Nur-Sultan in 2019).</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>From 1929 to 1936, the city, then known as Alma-Ata, was the capital of the Kazakh ASSR. 
    <br>
    From 1936 to 1991, Alma-Ata was the capital of the Kazakh SSR. After Kazakhstan became independent in 1991,
    <br> 
    the city was renamed Almaty in 1993 and continued as the capital until 1997, when the capital was moved to Akmola. 
    <br>
    Since then Almaty has been referred to as the 'southern capital' of Kazakhstan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Prehistoric Almaty</h3>
<p>
    <li>During 1000–900 BC in the Bronze Age, the first farmers and cattle-breeders established settlements in the territory of Almaty.</li> 
    <li>During the Saka period (from 700 BC to the beginning of the Christian era), these lands were occupied by the Saka and later Wusun tribes,</li> 
        who inhabited the territory north of the Tian Shan mountain range. Evidence of these times can be found in the numerous burial mounds (tumuli) and ancient settlements, 
        <br>
        especially the giant burial mounds of the Saka tsars. The most famous archaeological finds have been "The Golden Man", also known as "The Golden Warrior", 
        <br>
        from the Issyk Kurgan; the Zhalauly treasure, the Kargaly diadem, and the Zhetysu arts bronzes (boilers, lamps and altars). 
    <li>During the period of Saka and Wusun governance, Almaty became an early education centre.</li>
<h3>Middle Ages</h3>
In the 15th–18th centuries, the city was in decline as trade activities were decreasing on this part of the Silk Road. 
    <br>
    European nations were conducting more overseas trade by shipping. This period was one of crucial ethnic and political transformations.
<h3>Foundation of Verny</h3>
To defend its empire, Russia built Fort Verny near the Trans-Ili Alatau mountain range between the Bolshaya and Malenkaya Almatinka rivers. 
    <br>
    Construction began on 4 February 1854 and was nearly completed by the autumn of that year.
<h3>Industrialization</h3>
After 1941, due to the mass evacuation of factories and workers from the European part of the Soviet Union during World War II, Alma-Ata became an administrative and trading centre. 
    <br>Although it had an underdeveloped industrial base it became one of the largest industrial centres of the Soviet Union. It was to the rear of the wartime fronts.
<h3>Urban development</h3>
From 1966 to 1971, 1,400,000 square metres of public and cooperative housing were built. Annually, around 300,000 square metres of dwellings were under construction. 
    <br>
    Most of the buildings constructed during this time were earthquake-proof multi-story buildings. The Soviet government tried to diversify architectural forms to create a more varied cityscape. 
    <br>
    During this period, many schools, hospitals, cultural, and entertainment facilities were constructed, including Lenin's Palace, the Kazakhstan Hotel, and the Medeo Sports Complex.
<h3>Post–independence</h3>
Kazakhstan declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 16 December 1991, and one year later, on 28 January 1993, the government renamed the city from the Russian Alma-Ata to the Kazakh name Almaty.</p>
